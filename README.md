# Wifi_Connection_Between_Picos
With this code one can send and receive data from pico to pico over a wifi network.
In order to make this code work you need to define your wifis ssid and password on line 8.
You should put the picos on the same wifi network in the code on line 8.


When you put the code on two picos you need to find the ip address of them which you can get from the code itself.
You should put the ip address on the other device's code (The code prints the ip address of the device) for example. 
Lets say we have two picos Pico1 and Pico2. You should put Pico1s ip into Pico2s code and vice versa.
